**Hand Gesture Recognition with MediaPipe and Tkinter**
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and Tkinter for creating a simple graphical user interface. The application captures video input from the webcam and processes it to detect hand landmarks, subsequently classifying gestures based on the angle between the thumb and index finger.

**Features**
Real-time hand gesture recognition.
Supports gestures such as Closed Fist, Open Palm, Pointing Up, Thumb Down, Thumb Up, Victory, and ILoveYou.
User-friendly Tkinter interface displaying the live webcam feed and recognized gestures.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
MediaPipe
OpenCV
Pillow (PIL)
Tkinter
